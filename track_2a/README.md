# Academia Challenges

Submissions must use the Apertus model family.
For Track 2 this means that submitted solutions must be built with Apertus. Other open-weights models can be used to support development, e.g. as automatic judges during evaluation. Their role must be clearly described in the submission report.

## How it works
Pick from 5 academia challenges provided by Swiss academic institutions:

- **FHGR:** AI-Powered Job Interview Coach
- **OpenParlData:** Extracting Parliamentary Affairs from PDFs into One Common Structure
- **OST:** Multilingual Natural Language Inference over Swiss Official Voting Booklets
- **UZH:** Detecting Cross-Lingual Semantic Differences in Swiss Government Websites

The challenges incl. submission and judging criteria are described in our **Getting Started guide**:

## Run it

Keep `track_2a/` as it is: don't rename it or move its files, just delete the
other track directories.

From the root of the project:

```bash
make run
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

The [Makefile](Makefile) executes an automated multi-stage Docker build that runs the cross-cantonal verification benchmark and serves the interactive SEVERIN web platform on port `8000`.

### Requirements Specification:
- **Runtime**: Docker & Docker Compose (multi-stage container bundles Python 3.11-slim & Node 20-slim).
- **Hardware**: Standard CPU, 4 GB RAM. Inference executes remotely on CSCS Alps (NVIDIA GH200).
- **API Keys**: `CSCS_INFERENCE_API_KEY` (if omitted, automatically executes in 100% offline dry-run mode).
- **Model Weights**: `swiss-ai/Apertus-v1.5-8B` (remotely hosted on CSCS vLLM endpoint, no local download required).

## Data
The `data/` directory must not exceed 100 MB.
